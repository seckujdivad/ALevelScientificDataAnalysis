This was my A-Level Computer Science coursework project. The intention was to create one program that could be used to process and interpret data from A-Level Physics practicals. You can do this through a sophisticated formula system as well as a table and graph plotter.

If you want to get started, run `Data Analyser.py` and try opening the example project at `/user/examples/Characteristics of a potato cell.db`. There are also some help texts in the toolbar that you can read to better explain the project.
